Energy Savings Habit Tracker
Category: Renewable Energy
Difficulty Level: Basic–Intermediate
Time Required: 30 hours
Format: Solo
________________________________________
Problem Statement:
In most homes and hostels, fans, lights, and appliances are left switched on unnecessarily. Students and professionals rarely track how much electricity they consume or waste daily. This lack of awareness prevents them from adopting small energy-saving habits that could reduce both their bills and carbon footprint.
________________________________________
Solution:
Develop a digital energy habit tracker (Excel/Notion/Python tool) where users can log simple daily actions—such as switching off lights when leaving a room, setting the AC at 24°C, or unplugging chargers. The tracker will calculate approximate units of electricity saved and translate that into money saved + CO₂ reduction.
Accompany this with Canva-designed posters encouraging peers to commit to “1 new energy-saving habit for a week” and monitor the results.
